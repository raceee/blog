In this post we will be discussing the video game genre MMORPG's (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) specifically we will be revamping World of Warcraft (WoW). WoW has recently lost a huge portion of its player base due to poor gameplay evolution over the last few years and by sexual assualts against women within the company. These events in combination has inspired the World of Warcarft player base to leave demoting WoW as the most played MMORPG for the first time. Across the community WoW (and othe MMORPG's) we have come up with this speculation of problems that the game is having
1. MMORPG's have an outdated buisness model and do not make enough money, or at least, their monthly active user (MAU) base does not have the same ROI as other large titles have. This motivates developers and administrators to "penny and dime" players with in game stores and gut employees that make the game better for the players.
2. Balancing the combination of Race, Class, and Class Specification is becoming a inhuman task, gameplay usually breaks when new balance patches are introduced.
3. Freedom of Choice is not real. Player communities socially optimize the system and instantiate social standards of how you are supposed to play the game.
4. MMORPG's take lots of time and take even more time from guild leadership to plan fun events for the players.
5. MMORPG's have become games that you play alone.

2. Enemies Learn to Kill You
3. Social Restructuring
4. Botting and Risk
5. Suspension of Disbelief


## Preliminaries
Here we are going throw out quick "napkin scratching" ideas.
1. No more surveys. WoW has databases filled with all of the text that is commentary players provide while playing the game.
