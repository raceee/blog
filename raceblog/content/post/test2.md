## Introduction

In this post we will be discussing the MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) specifically we will be revamping World of Warcraft (WoW) published by Activision-Blizzard (market cap $75B). Recently, the development team for World of Warcraft and Activision-Blizzard as a whole have been servered multiple court cases on the grounds of substantiated sexual assault and harrassment of female employees. This, and years of mounting frustration with gameplay, has inspired a four month blizkriege-esque retreat from WoW to MMORPG's published by Square Enix and Amazon Games Studios, demoting World of Warcraft from the most played MMORPG for the first time since 2004. The change in power plunged Activision-Blizzard's stock price 16%.

Entertainment comes and goes, but the World of Warcraft community has lost the place where their group of friends all over the world come to spend time together. Understandably, lots of lingering players are talking about how to bring it back, and so will we. The community as talked about many problems they see in the game, we think that these problems are the foundational issues with the game and deserve technical solutions:

1. MMORPG's have an outdated buisness model and do not make enough money, or at least, their monthly active user (MAU) base does not have the same ROI as other large titles have. This motivates developers and administrators to "penny and dime" players with in game stores and gut employees that make the game better for the players.
2. Balancing the combination of Race, Class, and Class Specification is becoming a inhuman task, gameplay usually breaks when new balance patches are introduced.
3. Freedom of Choice is not real. Player communities socially optimize the system and instantiate social standards of how you are supposed to play the game.
4. MMORPG's take lots of time and take even more time from guild leadership to plan fun events for the players.
5. Players will play MMORPG's alone, if it is not obvious that they need to team up.
6. Without a common accountability that checks players and developers, developers will take advantage of their player base.


## Preliminaries
Here we are going throw out quick "napkin scratching" ideas.
1. No more surveys. WoW has databases filled with all of the text that is commentary players provide while playing the game.
